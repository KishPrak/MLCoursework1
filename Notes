Following rudimentary checks e.g. missing values

First considering if problem is linear - performing a simple correlation heatmap check
--> This yielded almost no correlation between anything and target, only depth had a reasonable correlation at -0.41
--> Odd that carat gave a 0.00 correlation 

Next tried mutual information relative ranking, to include non linear relationships
--> Yielded 0.00 for carat too, likely that is uninvolved (by itself as least)
--> Showed that depth was overwhelmingly important in comparison to others
--> b3,b1,a1,y,x receive notable mentions whilst the rest doesn't seem like much
