Brief set of instructions to run architecture to get model file and run on test set:

1. Clone and move into the repo
2. Install requirements.txt
3. Add the CW1_test_with_true_outcome.csv to the Data folder
4. Run CW1_eval_script.py (located in the Scripts folder) - alter script if needed to take into account that my csv file has a column title

Now you should have the output csv file and the R^2 value on the test set
